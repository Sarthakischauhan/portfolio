Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve spent most of my time developing for the webâ€”working on everything from pixel-perfect user interfaces to building robust RESTful APIs. 
Iâ€™ve truly enjoyed the journey, and I love that Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to learn and implement a variety of state-of-the-art technologies.
I initially started with game development but shifted to web development due to its accessibility. 
The ability to craft something from scratch and then publish it for others to use is deeply rewarding!  

However, my main goal now is to deepen my understanding of computer science and focus on exploring concepts that are new to me. This shift in focus stems from two key realizations:
- LLMs are becoming better at writing high level code - (**with few prompt tweaks**)
- I havenâ€™t yet challenged myself with really *fucking* hard problems involving math or algorithms.

## What are the main areas to study

1. ### Quantitative Analysis  
   I love the math involved in understanding and creating trading algorithms. I had a really hard time understanding the basic trillion-dollar equation, *aka* the **Black-Scholes model**, so it will be fun to explore it further.

2. ### Computer Vision  
   I am currently taking a class and studying this field in my free time. While my basics are solid, I struggle to come up with solutions to some real-world problems. My main goal is to get a shot at working with a team focused on full self-driving technology.

3. ### Learn More About LLMs (From a Research Perspective)  
   I regularly follow new models and experiment with their capabilities, but **transformers** and **LLMs**, in general, are still somewhat of a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) to me.

4. ### Upskill My Development Skills  
   Iâ€™m eager to continue learning about product **development** and **engineering**, while staying up to date with the latest technologies that seem to emerge every week.

## Conclusion  
This year is going to be a game-changer for me as I dive deeper into these areas. Plus, I still have one more summer to land an internship, hone my skills, and get some insider knowledge about the industry before I go full throttle into it. Oh, and letâ€™s not forget academicsâ€”I should probably focus on that too. Who knows, I might even decide to do a masterâ€™s somewhere... Berkeley, hope you are reading this? ðŸ‘€
