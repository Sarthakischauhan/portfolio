  Before starting let's keep these things in mind about OAuth:
  <ul className="list-disc">
    <li>Stands for Open Authorization (GO FOSS!)</li>
    <li>Used for Authorization and not authentication (there is a catch tho!)</li>
    <li>It is not our **lord and savior** but it solves a lot of things for us</li>
    <li>It does have security concerns</li>
  </ul>

Keeping it very short! To best understand the need of such a protocol we should look at how it helps us in our daily internet lives.

Imagine visiting a website that requires credentials before you can access its wonderful services (I see you, Chegg!). You go to their login page only to find that it asks for your email address and password. If you're like me, you'd be pissed by this absurdity. But then you spot those oddly shaped buttons at the bottom. Upon closer inspection, you realize they feature familiar faces, and you actually have accounts with some of them. After a few clicks, voila! youâ€™re in the website and can go about your day.
All this couldn't have had happened without our darling OAuth protocol ðŸ¥‚.

<h1 className="m-0 p-0">**How does it work?**</h1>
</div>
To explain in simple terms, we will take an example of the classic cryptography duo, Alice and Bob. Let's say Alice wants to view Bob's progress in the gym and decides to ask the gym for this information. It is important that the gym knows whether Alice is allowed to view the progress data. To tackle this, Bob can ask the gym to assign Alice a token that will serve as a testament to the fact that Bob has allowed Alice to view specific data on his behalf.
For all my visual learners, **Take a look at the image below**.
