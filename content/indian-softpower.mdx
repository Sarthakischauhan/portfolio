  "This is indeed India! The land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty, of splendour and rags, of palaces and hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers and elephants... the one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the globe combined."

<span className="text-lg font-medium">India</span> is one of the two oldest civilizations still thriving in the modern world. With a rich tapestry of cultures, languages, and histories, it is a living testament to human endurance and adaptability. Its geographical position, pivotal role in global trade, and sheer historical depth make it an undeniable force in shaping the world’s narrative.

Yet, there is a paradox. While the nation commands respect and attention on the global stage, its people often struggle to hold the same individual influence collectively. This dichotomy between India’s civilizational legacy and the soft power of its people is a nuanced issue that warrants deep thought and introspection.

The truth is, we often have ourselves to blame for the stereotypes and prejudices we face. Many in our community, particularly in major Western cities, fail to integrate meaningfully into their new surroundings. 

While preserving your culture is essential, outright rejecting the norms and values of your adopted home reflects a refusal to adapt—a stark example of the infamous Indian "chalta hai" attitude. From shoplifting in stores, taking advantage of systems meant for the underprivileged, or creating insular bubbles instead of engaging with the local community, these behaviors feed into the very stereotypes we resent. 

When individuals refuse to learn the language, respect local customs, or contribute back to society, it sends a message of disregard for their new home. This lack of accountability undermines the image of an otherwise talented, resourceful, and hardworking diaspora and fuels the very biases we often feel unfairly targeted by.

Change is one of humanity’s most beautiful and universal traits. Across societies and cultures, people evolve—adapting to new environments, ideas, and ways of life, often without even realizing it. 
**It’s what allows us to grow collectively, blending traditions with modernity to create something richer.**

However, the resistance to change, whether out of fear, pride, or complacency, often holds communities back. Acknowledging and embracing this natural evolution isn’t about losing one’s identity—it’s about finding balance between preserving the old and thriving in the new.

I wouldn’t shy away from saying that we are not the sole cause of this issue—our share is perhaps only 30% of the problem. While we must address our shortcomings, it’s equally important to recognize and call out these broader societal issues.


<span className="text-white opacity-80">The reality is, racism exists across all sections of society, and the United States, while blessed with multiculturalism, is no exception. Prejudices, biases, and systemic issues persist, affecting not just Indians but many communities striving to find their place in a diverse and often divided landscape.</span>
